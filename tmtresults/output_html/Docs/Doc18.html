PHAEDRUS
  PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: SOCRATES; PHAEDRUS. Scene: Under a
plane-tree, by the banks of the Ilissus.

  Socrates. My dear Phaedrus, whence come you, and whither are you
going?
  Phaedrus. I come from Lysias the son of Cephalus, and I am going
to take a walk outside the wall, for I have been sitting with him
the whole morning; and our common friend Acumenus tells me that it
is much more refreshing to walk in the open air than to be shut up
in a cloister.
  Soc. There he is right. Lysias then, I suppose, was in the town?
  Phaedr. Yes, he was staying with Epicrates, here at the house of
Morychus; that house which is near the temple of Olympian Zeus.
  Soc. And how did he entertain you? Can I be wrong in supposing
that Lysias gave you a feast of discourse?
  Phaedr. You shall hear, if you can spare time to accompany me.
  Soc. And should I not deem the conversation of you and Lysias "a
thing of higher import," as I may say in the words of Pindar, "than
any business"?
  Phaedr. Will you go on?
  Soc. And will you go on with the narration?
  Phaedr. My tale, Socrates, is one of your sort, for love was the
theme which occupied us -love after a fashion: Lysias has been writing
about a fair youth who was being tempted, but not by a lover; and this
was the point: he ingeniously proved that the non-lover should be
accepted rather than the lover.
  Soc. O that is noble of him! I wish that he would say the poor man
rather than the rich, and the old man rather than the young one;
then he would meet the case of me and of many a man; his words would
be quite refreshing, and he would be a public benefactor. For my part,
I do so long to hear his speech, that if you walk all the way to
Megara, and when you have reached the wall come back, as Herodicus
recommends, without going in, I will keep you company.
  Phaedr. What do you mean, my good Socrates? How can you imagine that
my unpractised memory can do justice to an elaborate work, which the
greatest rhetorician of the age spent a long time in composing.
Indeed, I cannot; I would give a great deal if I could.
  Soc. I believe that I know Phaedrus about as well as I know
myself, and I am very sure that the speech of Lysias was repeated to
him, not once only, but again and again;-he insisted on hearing it
many times over and Lysias was very willing to gratify him; at last,
when nothing else would do, he got hold of the book, and looked at
what he most wanted to see,-this occupied him during the whole
morning; -and then when he was tired with sitting, he went out to take
a walk, not until, by the dog, as I believe, he had simply learned
by heart the entire discourse, unless it was unusually long, and he
went to a place outside the wall that he might practise his lesson.
There he saw a certain lover of discourse who had a similar
weakness;-he saw and rejoiced; now thought he, "I shall have a partner
in my revels." And he invited him to come and walk with him. But
when the lover of discourse begged that he would repeat the tale, he
gave himself airs and said, "No I cannot," as if he were indisposed;
although, if the hearer had refused, he would sooner or later have
been compelled by him to listen whether he would or no. Therefore,
Phaedrus, bid him do at once what he will soon do whether bidden or
not.
  Phaedr. I see that you will not let me off until I speak in some
fashion or other; verily therefore my best plan is to speak as I
best can.
  Soc. A very true remark, that of yours.
  Phaedr. I will do as I say; but believe me, Socrates, I did not
learn the very words-O no; nevertheless I have a general notion of
what he said, and will give you a summary of the points in which the
lover differed from the non-lover. Let me begin at the beginning.
  Soc. Yes, my sweet one; but you must first of all show what you have
in your left hand under your cloak, for that roll, as I suspect, is
the actual discourse. Now, much as I love you, I would not have you
suppose that I am going to have your memory exercised at my expense,
if you have Lysias himself here.
  Phaedr. Enough; I see that I have no hope of practising my art
upon you. But if I am to read, where would you please to sit?
  Soc. Let us turn aside and go by the Ilissus; we will sit down at
some quiet spot.
  Phaedr. I am fortunate in not having my sandals, and as you never
have any, I think that we may go along the brook and cool our feet
in the water; this will be the easiest way, and at midday and in the
summer is far from being unpleasant.
  Soc. Lead on, and look out for a place in which we can sit down.
  Phaedr. Do you see the tallest plane-tree in the distance?
  Soc. Yes.
  Phaedr. There are shade and gentle breezes, and grass on which we
may either sit or lie down.
  Soc. Move forward.
  Phaedr. I should like to know, Socrates, whether the place is not
somewhere here at which Boreas is said to have carried off Orithyia
from the banks of the Ilissus?
  Soc. Such is the tradition.
  Phaedr. And is this the exact spot? The little stream is
delightfully clear and bright; I can fancy that there might be maidens
playing near.
  Soc. I believe that the spot is not exactly here, but about a
quarter of a mile lower down, where you cross to the temple of
Artemis, and there is, I think, some sort of an altar of Boreas at the
place.
  Phaedr. I have never noticed it; but I beseech you to tell me,
Socrates, do you believe this tale?
  Soc. The wise are doubtful, and I should not be singular if, like
them, I too doubted. I might have a rational explanation that Orithyia
was playing with Pharmacia, when a northern gust carried her over
the neighbouring rocks; and this being the manner of her death, she
was said to have been carried away by Boreas. There is a
discrepancy, however, about the locality; according to another version
of the story she was taken from Areopagus, and not from this place.
Now I quite acknowledge that these allegories are very nice, but he is
not to be envied who has to invent them; much labour and ingenuity
will be required of him; and when he has once begun, he must go on and
rehabilitate Hippocentaurs and chimeras dire. Gorgons and winged
steeds flow in apace, and numberless other inconceivable and
portentous natures. And if he is sceptical about them, and would
fain reduce them one after another to the rules of probability, this
sort of crude philosophy will take up a great deal of time. Now I have
no leisure for such enquiries; shall I tell you why? I must first know
myself, as the Delphian inscription says; to be curious about that
which is not my concern, while I am still in ignorance of my own self,
would be ridiculous. And therefore I bid farewell to all this; the
common opinion is enough for me. For, as I was saying, I want to
know not about this, but about myself: am I a monster more complicated
and swollen with passion than the serpent Typho, or a creature of a
gentler and simpler sort, to whom Nature has given a diviner and
lowlier destiny? But let me ask you, friend: have we not reached the
plane-tree to which you were conducting us?
  Phaedr. Yes, this is the tree.
  Soc. By Here, a fair resting-place, full of summer sounds and
scents. Here is this lofty and spreading plane-tree, and the agnus
cast us high and clustering, in the fullest blossom and the greatest
fragrance; and the stream which flows beneath the plane-tree is
deliciously cold to the feet. Judging from the ornaments and images,
this must be a spot sacred to Achelous and the Nymphs. How
delightful is the breeze:-so very sweet; and there is a sound in the
air shrill and summerlike which makes answer to the chorus of the
cicadae. But the greatest charm of all is the grass, like a pillow
gently sloping to the head. My dear Phaedrus, you have been an
admirable guide.
  Phaedr. What an incomprehensible being you are, Socrates: when you
are in the country, as you say, you really are like some stranger
who is led about by a guide. Do you ever cross the border? I rather
think that you never venture even outside the gates.
  Soc. Very true, my good friend; and I hope that you will excuse me
when you hear the reason, which is, that I am a lover of knowledge,
and the men who dwell in the city are my teachers, and not the trees
or the country. Though I do indeed believe that you have found a spell
with which to draw me out of the city into the country, like a
hungry cow before whom a bough or a bunch of fruit is waved. For
only hold up before me in like manner a book, and you may lead me
all round Attica, and over the wide world. And now having arrived, I
intend to lie down, and do you choose any posture in which you can
read best. Begin.
  Phaedr. Listen. You know how matters stand with me; and how, as I
conceive, this affair may be arranged for the advantage of both of us.
And I maintain that I ought not to fail in my suit, because I am not
your lover: for lovers repent of the kindnesses which they have
shown when their passion ceases, but to the non-lovers who are free
and not under any compulsion, no time of repentance ever comes; for
they confer their benefits according to the measure of their
ability, in the way which is most conducive to their own interest.
Then again, lovers consider how by reason of their love they have
neglected their own concerns and rendered service to others: and
when to these benefits conferred they add on the troubles which they
have endured, they think that they have long ago made to the beloved a
very ample return. But the non-lover has no such tormenting
recollections; he has never neglected his affairs or quarrelled with
his relations; he has no troubles to add up or excuse to invent; and
being well rid of all these evils, why should he not freely do what
will gratify the beloved?
  If you say that the lover is more to be esteemed, because his love
is thought to be greater; for he is willing to say and do what is
hateful to other men, in order to please his beloved;-that, if true,
is only a proof that he will prefer any future love to his present,
and will injure his old love at the pleasure of the new. And how, in a
matter of such infinite importance, can a man be right in trusting
himself to one who is afflicted with a malady which no experienced
person would attempt to cure, for the patient himself admits that he
is not in his right mind, and acknowledges that he is wrong in his
mind, but says that he is unable to control himself? And if he came to
his right mind, would he ever imagine that the desires were good which
he conceived when in his wrong mind? Once more, there are many more
non-lovers than lovers; and if you choose the best of the lovers,
you will not have many to choose from; but if from the non-lovers, the
choice will be larger, and you will be far more likely to find among
them a person who is worthy of your friendship. If public opinion be
your dread, and you would avoid reproach, in all probability the
lover, who is always thinking that other men are as emulous of him
as he is of them, will boast to some one of his successes, and make
a show of them openly in the pride of his heart;-he wants others to
know that his labour has not been lost; but the non-lover is more
his own master, and is desirous of solid good, and not of the
opinion of mankind. Again, the lover may be generally noted or seen
following the beloved (this is his regular occupation), and whenever
they are observed to exchange two words they are supposed to meet
about some affair of love either past or in contemplation; but when
non-lovers meet, no one asks the reason why, because people know
that talking to another is natural, whether friendship or mere
pleasure be the motive.
  Once more, if you fear the fickleness of friendship, consider that
in any other case a quarrel might be a mutual calamity; but now,
when you have given up what is most precious to you, you will be the
greater loser, and therefore, you will have more reason in being
afraid of the lover, for his vexations are many, and he is always
fancying that every one is leagued against him. Wherefore also he
debars his beloved from society; he will not have you intimate with
the wealthy, lest they should exceed him in wealth, or with men of
education, lest they should be his superiors in understanding; and
he is equally afraid of anybody's influence who has any other
advantage over himself. If he can persuade you to break with them, you
are left without friend in the world; or if, out of a regard to your
own interest, you have more sense than to comply with his desire,
you will have to quarrel with him. But those who are non-lovers, and
whose success in love is the reward of their merit, will not be
jealous of the companions of their beloved, and will rather hate those
who refuse to be his associates, thinking that their favourite is
slighted by the latter and benefited by the former; for more love than
hatred may be expected to come to him out of his friendship with
others. Many lovers too have loved the person of a youth before they
knew his character or his belongings; so that when their passion has
passed away, there is no knowing whether they will continue to be
his friends; whereas, in the case of non-lovers who were always
friends, the friendship is not lessened by the favours granted; but
the recollection of these remains with them, and is an earnest of good
things to come.
  Further, I say that you are likely to be improved by me, whereas the
lover will spoil you. For they praise your words and actions in a
wrong way; partly, because they are afraid of offending you, and also,
their judgment is weakened by passion. Such are the feats which love
exhibits; he makes things painful to the disappointed which give no
pain to others; he compels the successful lover to praise what ought
not to give him pleasure, and therefore the beloved is to be pitied
rather than envied. But if you listen to me, in the first place, I, in
my intercourse with you, shall not merely regard present enjoyment,
but also future advantage, being not mastered by love, but my own
master; nor for small causes taking violent dislikes, but even when
the cause is great, slowly laying up little wrath-unintentional
offences I shall forgive, and intentional ones I shall try to prevent;
and these are the marks of a friendship which will last.
  Do you think that a lover only can be a firm friend? reflect:-if
this were true, we should set small value on sons, or fathers, or
mothers; nor should we ever have loyal friends, for our love of them
arises not from passion, but from other associations. Further, if we
ought to shower favours on those who are the most eager suitors,-on
that principle, we ought always to do good, not to the most
virtuous, but to the most needy; for they are the persons who will
be most relieved, and will therefore be the most grateful; and when
you make a feast you should invite not your friend, but the beggar and
the empty soul; for they will love you, and attend you, and come about
your doors, and will be the best pleased, and the most grateful, and
will invoke many a blessing on your head. Yet surely you ought not
to be granting favours to those who besiege you with prayer, but to
those who are best able to reward you; nor to the lover only, but to
those who are worthy of love; nor to those who will enjoy the bloom of
your youth, but to those who will share their possessions with you
in age; nor to those who, having succeeded, will glory in their
success to others, but to those who will be modest and tell no
tales; nor to those who care about you for a moment only, but to those
who will continue your friends through life; nor to those who, when
their passion is over, will pick a quarrel with you, but rather to
those who, when the charm of youth has left you, will show their own
virtue. Remember what I have said; and consider yet this further
point: friends admonish the lover under the idea that his way of
life is bad, but no one of his kindred ever yet censured the
non-lover, or thought that he was ill-advised about his own interests.
  "Perhaps you will ask me whether I propose that you should indulge
every non-lover. To which I reply that not even the lover would advise
you to indulge all lovers, for the indiscriminate favour is less
esteemed by the rational recipient, and less easily hidden by him
who would escape the censure of the world. Now love ought to be for
the advantage of both parties, and for the injury of neither.
  "I believe that I have said enough; but if there is anything more
which you desire or which in your opinion needs to be supplied, ask
and I will answer."
  Now, Socrates, what do you think? Is not the discourse excellent,
more especially in the matter of the language?
  Soc. Yes, quite admirable; the effect on me was ravishing. And
this I owe to you, Phaedrus, for I observed you while reading to be in
an ecstasy, and thinking that you are more experienced in these
matters than I am, I followed your example, and, like you, my divine
darling, I became inspired with a phrenzy.
  Phaedr. Indeed, you are pleased to be merry.
  Soc. Do you mean that I am not in earnest?
  Phaedr. Now don't talk in that way, Socrates, but let me have your
real opinion; I adjure you, by Zeus, the god of friendship, to tell me
whether you think that any Hellene could have said more or spoken
better on the same subject.
  Soc. Well, but are you and I expected to praise the sentiments of
the author, or only the clearness, and roundness, and finish, and
tournure of the language? As to the first I willingly submit to your
better judgment, for I am not worthy to form an opinion, having only
attended to the rhetorical manner; and I was doubting whether this
could have been defended even by Lysias himself; I thought, though I
speak under correction, that he repeated himself two or three times,
either from want of words or from want of pains; and also, he appeared
to me ostentatiously to exult in showing how well he could say the
same thing in two or three ways.
  Phaedr. Nonsense, Socrates; what you call repetition was the
especial merit of the speech; for he omitted no topic of which the
subject rightly allowed, and I do not think that any one could have
spoken better or more exhaustively.
  Soc. There I cannot go along with you. Ancient sages, men and women,
who have spoken and written of these things, would rise up in judgment
against me, if out of complaisance I assented to you.
  Phaedr. Who are they, and where did you hear anything better than
this?
  Soc. I am sure that I must have heard; but at this moment I do not
remember from whom; perhaps from Sappho the fair, or Anacreon the
wise; or, possibly, from a prose writer. Why do I say so? Why, because
I perceive that my bosom is full, and that I could make another speech
as good as that of Lysias, and different. Now I am certain that this
is not an invention of my own, who am well aware that I know
nothing, and therefore I can only infer that I have been filled
through the cars, like a pitcher, from the waters of another, though I
have actually forgotten in my stupidity who was my informant.
  Phaedr. That is grand:-but never mind where you beard the
discourse or from whom; let that be a mystery not to be divulged
even at my earnest desire. Only, as you say, promise to make another
and better oration, equal in length and entirely new, on the same
subject; and I, like the nine Archons, will promise to set up a golden
image at Delphi, not only of myself, but of you, and as large as life.
  Soc. You are a dear golden ass if you suppose me to mean that Lysias
has altogether missed the mark, and that I can make a speech from
which all his arguments are to be excluded. The worst of authors
will say something which is to the point. Who, for example, could
speak on this thesis of yours without praising the discretion of the
non-lover and blaming the indiscretion of the lover? These are the
commonplaces of the subject which must come in (for what else is there
to be said?) and must be allowed and excused; the only merit is in the
arrangement of them, for there can be none in the invention; but
when you leave the commonplaces, then there may be some originality.
  Phaedr. I admit that there is reason in what you say, and I too will
be reasonable, and will allow you to start with the premiss that the
lover is more disordered in his wits than the non-lover; if in what
remains you make a longer and better speech than Lysias, and use other
arguments, then I say again, that a statue you shall have of beaten
gold, and take your place by the colossal offerings of the Cypselids
at Olympia.
  Soc. How profoundly in earnest is the lover, because to tease him
I lay a finger upon his love! And so, Phaedrus, you really imagine
that I am going to improve upon the ingenuity of Lysias?
  Phaedr. There I have you as you had me, and you must just speak
"as you best can." Do not let us exchange "tu quoque" as in a farce,
or compel me to say to you as you said to me, "I know Socrates as well
as I know myself, and he was wanting to, speak, but he gave himself
airs." Rather I would have you consider that from this place we stir
not until you have unbosomed yourself of the speech; for here are we
all alone, and I am stronger, remember, and younger than you-Wherefore
perpend, and do not compel me to use violence.
  Soc. But, my sweet Phaedrus, how ridiculous it would be of me to
compete with Lysias in an extempore speech! He is a master in his
art and I am an untaught man.
  Phaedr. You see how matters stand; and therefore let there be no
more pretences; for, indeed, I know the word that is irresistible.
  Soc. Then don't say it.
  Phaedr. Yes, but I will; and my word shall be an oath. "I say, or
rather swear"-but what god will be witness of my oath?-"By this
plane-tree I swear, that unless you repeat the discourse here in the
face of this very plane-tree, I will never tell you another; never let
you have word of another!"
  Soc. Villain I am conquered; the poor lover of discourse has no more
to say.
  Phaedr. Then why are you still at your tricks?
  Soc. I am not going to play tricks now that you have taken the oath,
for I cannot allow myself to be starved.
  Phaedr. Proceed.
  Soc. Shall I tell you what I will do?
  Phaedr. What?
  Soc. I will veil my face and gallop through the discourse as fast as
I can, for if I see you I shall feel ashamed and not know what to say.
  Phaedr. Only go on and you may do anything else which you please.
  Soc. Come, O ye Muses, melodious, as ye are called, whether you have
received this name from the character of your strains, or because
the Melians are a musical race, help, O help me in the tale which my
good friend here desires me to rehearse, in order that his friend whom
he always deemed wise may seem to him to be wiser than ever.
  Once upon a time there was a fair boy, or, more properly speaking, a
youth; he was very fair and had a great many lovers; and there was one
special cunning one, who had persuaded the youth that he did not
love him, but he really loved him all the same; and one day when he
was paying his addresses to him, he used this very argument-that he
ought to accept the non-lover rather than the lover; his words were as
follows:-
  "All good counsel begins in the same way; a man should know what
he is advising about, or his counsel will all come to nought. But
people imagine that they know about the nature of things, when they
don't know about them, and, not having come to an understanding at
first because they think that they know, they end, as might be
expected, in contradicting one another and themselves. Now you and I
must not be guilty of this fundamental error which we condemn in
others; but as our question is whether the lover or non-lover is to be
preferred, let us first of all agree in defining the nature and
power of love, and then, keeping our eyes upon the definition and to
this appealing, let us further enquire whether love brings advantage
or disadvantage.
  "Every one sees that love is a desire, and we know also that
non-lovers desire the beautiful and good. Now in what way is the lover
to be distinguished from the non-lover? Let us note that in every
one of us there are two guiding and ruling principles which lead us
whither they will; one is the natural desire of pleasure, the other is
an acquired opinion which aspires after the best; and these two are
sometimes in harmony and then again at war, and sometimes the one,
sometimes the other conquers. When opinion by the help of reason leads
us to the best, the conquering principle is called temperance; but
when desire, which is devoid of reason, rules in us and drags us to
pleasure, that power of misrule is called excess. Now excess has
many names, and many members, and many forms, and any of these forms
when very marked gives a name, neither honourable nor creditable, to
the bearer of the name. The desire of eating, for example, which
gets the better of the higher reason and the other desires, is
called gluttony, and he who is possessed by it is called a glutton-I
the tyrannical desire of drink, which inclines the possessor of the
desire to drink, has a name which is only too obvious, and there can
be as little doubt by what name any other appetite of the same
family would be called;-it will be the name of that which happens to
be eluminant. And now I think that you will perceive the drift of my
discourse; but as every spoken word is in a manner plainer than the
unspoken, I had better say further that the irrational desire which
overcomes the tendency of opinion towards right, and is led away to
the enjoyment of beauty, and especially of personal beauty, by the
desires which are her own kindred-that supreme desire, I say, which by
leading conquers and by the force of passion is reinforced, from
this very force, receiving a name, is called love."
  And now, dear Phaedrus, I shall pause for an instant to ask
whether you do not think me, as I appear to myself, inspired?
  Phaedr. Yes, Socrates, you seem to have a very unusual flow of
words.
  Soc. Listen to me, then, in silence; for surely the place is holy;
so that you must not wonder, if, as I proceed, I appear to be in a
divine fury, for already I am getting into dithyrambics.
  Phaedr. Nothing can be truer.
  Soc. The responsibility rests with you. But hear what follows, and
Perhaps the fit may be averted; all is in their hands above.
